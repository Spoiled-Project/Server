The current directory contains all the nural networks.
Each nural network detects a serie which its name is the directory's name.

To add a serie all you need to do is add the trained nural network to a new directory.
Then add it files: __init__.py, nural_detector.py

The "__init__.py file would contain the code:

from nural_detector import detect_serie

__all__ = ['detect_serie']



The "nural_detector.py" file will contains the function "def detect_serie(image)" which will be se too receives a picture
in (#TODO put resolution) and returns if the received pic is a spoiler.

When finished, at the "__init__.py" of the "Series" directory, add to the class the method:

from ${your dir name} import nural_detector as ${Your serie name with '_' spaces}

When pushed to the git hub and merged to the main branch, after the github Action, the server would support the new serie.
